# ETL_estimation
This repository showcases the control variate variance reduction methodology for estimating expected tranche loss in a One-Factor Levy Threshold Model for dependent defaults. The repository consists of three main files. 

  ### functions.py consists of all the core functionality for the methodology. 
  ### output_analysis.ipynb calls the functions in functions.py to generate ETL data and display plots.  
  ### MSc_Thesis.pdf presents the variance reduction technique and provides a performance/sensitivity analysis
